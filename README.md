# Video Bastard

### A desktop app being built with the sole purpose of automating the entire Content Creator flow.

#### [or more specifically: me, messing around with Electron and React after quite a while]

Electron desktop app configured to run (only in dev mode/locally atm) take news URLs, send them to Chat GPT or Llama, paraphrase with a snarky, sarcastic tone - then hand them to an Avatar generation library.

Avatar video is then played in-app and will ultimately be uploaded to YouTube.
